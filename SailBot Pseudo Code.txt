############pseudo code and ideas for sail bot##############

INPUTS
	User commands
	apparent wind velocity
	heel angle
	boat's velocity
	camera, radar, and lidar sensors
		determine position of marks, other boats, and obstacles
	GPS

OUTPUTS
    Execute Mechanical Control Operations
	    jib and main sheet, rudder actuation, backstay and other tuning
	Display data to the user
		point of sail, speed, wind direction, compase heading
	
MVP (minimum viable product)
    get the boat to sail on a straight beam reach course autonomusly
			
	#control main and jib angles of attack
	if luffing. check sheet tensions by analysing the resistance on the motor:
		main.sheet()
		jib.sheet()
	if over powered, heel angle > specific limit: 
		main.ease()
		jib.ease()
	if stalling ease sails. speed < expected speed:
		main.ease()
		jib.ease()
    #verify sail position with expected point of sail from apparent wind
    #balance helm against weather and lee helm
	if weather helm indicated by excessive rudder angle:
		main.ease()
		jib.sheet()
	if lee helm indicated by excessive rudder angle:
	    main.sheet()
		jib.ease()
    #measure apparent wind direction, and calculate true wind direction.
    #adjust course accordingly.
    trueWind = appWind - boatVel  #these will all have to be vectors somehow
	#sailingAngle = calculate the angle between boatVel and trueWind
	sailingAngle = invCos(boatVel*trueWind/(|boatVel||trueWind|))
	#control direction of travel, for beam reach, sailing Angle = 90 degrees
	if sailingAngle > intendedHeading + 2Â°:
		rudder left
	if sailingAngle < intendedHeading - 2Â°:
        rudder right
